### Hi there, I'm [Darshan!](https://darshansudhakar.github.io/) ğŸ‘‹

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a project that handles [Retail Management](https://github.com/DarshanSudhakar/RetailManager). With that I am working on [my personal portfolio site](https://github.com/DarshanSudhakar/darshansudhakar.github.io) in parallel
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Software Architecture
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on [Retail Management Project](https://github.com/DarshanSudhakar/RetailManager)
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about Money Management and programming
- âš¡ Fun fact: I use the word "Ok" more than needed :innocent:
